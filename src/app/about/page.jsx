          JapanMan is more than just a website devoted to one of the most
          fascinating countries in the world. We have combined 15 years of Japan
          travel and consulting experience with custom-built technology to
          provide a one-stop shop for Japan holiday planning.

          JapanMan has lived in Tokyo, travelled the length and breadth of the
          country on dozens of adventures and designed hundreds of client
          itineraries. All the knowledge gained from those experiences can now
          be found here. There are more than a hundred things to do in Tokyo and
          Kyoto alone, with our curated excursions, experiences and
          accommodation all designed to help you make your holiday make sense.

          At the heart of JapanMan is our exclusive Itinerary Builder. It works
          with you to help make your dream Japan holiday a stress-free reality.
          Choose from dozens of template itineraries, add and swap out
          experiences including hundreds of custom JapanMan excursions as well
          as affiliate tours and accommodation, and use the provided links to
          book up your trip. Calibrate the itinerary to your flight dates, and
          it will automatically flag up potential schedule clashes, such as
          closing days. The Itinerary Builder has your back.
