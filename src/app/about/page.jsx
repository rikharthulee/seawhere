          Seawhere is a modern travel studio focused on Southeast Asia, built to
          make trip planning clearer, calmer, and more connected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform is founded by Richard Lee, who lives in Luang Prabang,
          Laos, and has spent years travelling extensively across Laos, Vietnam,
          Thailand, and Cambodia. That time on the ground, moving between towns,
          crossing borders, and learning how trips actually unfold day to day,
          shapes everything on Seawhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than overwhelming you with endless options, Seawhere brings
          together curated day itineraries, experiences, accommodation, and food
          picks that make sense geographically and logistically. The aim is
          simple: each day of your trip should flow naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the heart of Seawhere is the trip builder. Start with day itinerary
          templates or build from scratch, then add, swap, and organise days,
          experiences, tours, and hotels to match your dates. The planner
          highlights scheduling clashes, keeps everything in one place, and lets
          you book directly with trusted partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside the planner, Seawhere offers custom maps, regional travel
          tips, and practical guidance to help you stay oriented before and
          during your trip. All your ideas, notes, and confirmations stay
          together, with support always available if you need it.
